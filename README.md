# Face Recognition Attendance System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Face Recognition Attendance System** that automates student attendance tracking using facial recognition. It is designed for educational institutions where students can check in by scanning their faces at a designated device (e.g., a tablet placed at the entrance). 

## ✨ Features
- 📸 **Face Registration**: Students register their faces for attendance tracking.
- ✅ **Automated Attendance**: The system recognizes faces and marks attendance automatically.
- 🔒 **Secure & Reliable**: Prevents proxy attendance by ensuring unique facial recognition.
- 📊 **Attendance Reports**: Generates detailed attendance logs for analysis.
- 🌐 **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy usage.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition, NumPy, Pandas
- **Database**: SQLite (or alternative DBMS if needed)
- **Framework**: Flask (if building a web-based interface)

## 🏗️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- Required dependencies: 
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python dlib face-recognition numpy pandas flask
  ```

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-attendance.git
   cd face-attendance
   ```
2. **Run the face registration script**
   ```bash
   python register_faces.py
   ```
3. **Start the attendance system**
   ```bash
   python attendance_system.py
   ```
4. **Access reports**
   - Attendance records will be stored in the database and can be exported.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Student Registration**: The user registers their face using a webcam.
2. **Face Recognition**: The system captures a live feed and matches it with stored faces.
3. **Attendance Marking**: If a match is found, attendance is recorded in the database.
4. **Report Generation**: Administrators can view/export attendance records.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Deploy as a **web or mobile application**.
- Integrate with **RFID or QR code scanning**.
- Implement **real-time notifications**.
